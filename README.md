**Project Definition**

The robot must navigate desired pick-up zone to pick up the objects and deliver them to the drop-off zone. To navigate from source to destination, the robot first computes the shortest route path planning from source to destination. When the robot is traveling to its destination, it must constantly monitor its atmospheric surroundings and the robot has to reach its destination without hitting/crashing on obstacles.
